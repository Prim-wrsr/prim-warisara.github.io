          Living in Sydney ain’t cheap — my wallet’s been crying since day one 😂 But hey, don’t just take my word for it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I call myself 'generation 0' — my family helped me get started, but once I landed in Sydney, I had to hustle on my own. Every $AUD spent meant something to me. I came to Australia as an international student with no idea what was waiting ahead — but I knew I had to plan smart and stay aware.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Before I arrived, I promised myself I’d track my living expenses — not just to survive, but to better understand where my money was going. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sydney is known as one of the most expensive cities in Australia, especially for housing and everyday living — and yep, it lives up to the hype. I wanted to make my “soft landing” as smooth as possible and avoid big surprises.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So here’s what happened: I tracked every expense during my first 8 months.
            Then, to make sense of it all, I turned the data into a Power BI dashboard. This is just <strong>phase one</strong>
            <i>— I plan to expand it later to reflect a full picture of my 2-year journey. 📊</i>
        </p>
      
        <h3>Explore the dashboard and some things I learned along the way!</h3>

          </a>
          
      
        <h3>What I’ve Learned from My Spending</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes — housing costs are the heaviest burden. No surprise there. Ouch!!</li>
          <li>In September, I finally cracked the code: cooking at home saves me. That month, I had to pay tuition, so I tried eating in more — and it worked!</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="insight-note">...until tuition was paid and I treated myself back to eating out. 😅 It’s nice to discover how to reduce costs — but I still love exploring good food.</p>
